# User Journeys

MOMSI user journeys provide unique educational examples for assisting users with navigation and exploration between deliverables. Journeys explore curation activity themes covering MOMSI concepts curated in our landscape review expanding on the RDMkit research data lifecycle framework and subject domain research area terms linked to FAIRsharing standards types at our collection.

## MOMSI Research Data Lifecycle Journeys

The [Research Data Management toolkit for Life Sciences (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is just one of many global community resources supporting educational awareness around core data management concepts and best practices for proper handling of digital data at each stage of the research [data life cycle](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_life_cycle). The MOMSI landscape review dashboard curation workflow includes leveraging key concepts from RDMkit (Figure 1)and expands on this work to capture how each domain or generalist standard aligns to the research data lifecycle (where applicable). Capturing domain use-case research data lifecycle curations, as part of our curation criteria, is aimed to provide expert level (domain-informed) recommendation resources for non-expert professionals tasked with data management planning and forecasting tasks.

## MOMSI FAIRsharing Collection Journeys

The [MOMSI FAIRsharing Standard Collection (Deliverable 1b)](https://fairsharing.org/5742) is a refined and filtered down collection of domain specific and Omics relevant universal terminologies, metadata reporting guidelines, data models/formats, and identifier schemas. New and existing standards listed in this collection have undergone an iterative in-depth landscape review process using the MOMSI curation dashboard sustainability workflow.

New and existing standards listed in this collection have undergone an iterative in-depth landscape review process using the MOMSI curation dashboard sustainability workflow. This process involves evaluating the accuracy and completeness of each standard and the minimal information criteria required for curation. Our collection seeks to benefit and encourage continuous, open, and machine-actionable Multi-omics community standards curation, supporting evolving research data management and sharing best practices.

> - FAIRsharing is a community curated educational resource containing linked records representing data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies.
> - Guides users to discover, select, and implement standards located at our collection resulting stemming from this repository workflow.
> - Access machine-actionable trustworthy standard resources supporting data management tasks with confidence directly from the MOMSI dashboard. As a service provider FAIRsharing assigns both unique digital object identifiers and updated DOI citation timestamps reflecting the latest update.

### Beginner Journeys
