# MOMSI Terminology

MOMSI WG terms and concepts referenced in the glossary are organized and grouped by scoped curation activity themes covering topic areas and relationships for MOMSI Subject Areas (based on application technologies in sequencing and mass spectrometry), FAIRsharing Standards Types, and Research Data Lifecycle. Each term provided in the glossary contains a term, definition (and definition source), persistent identifier (where applicable), topic area (core category), and relation (subcategory). All terms listed in our Glossary are used in our Omics issue request templates.

## Glossary Table

Use indexed table example listed [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/creating-a-glossary/43593) with the following example hierarchy below taken from the Glossary folder note fields:

## Terms & Concepts Overview

### Standards
The MOMSI WG landscape review captures a set of curated community standard record types, as defined by [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/standards), in supporting FAIR machine-actionable resources and enriching existing RDA WG partnerships under a shared aim to improve data standard quality reporting, discovery, and reuse. 

### Term Identifiers
The MOMSI glossary leverages shared subject term identifiers from SRAO and EDAM in compatibility with tagged terms implemented by FAIRsharing for aligning semantics across the dashboard and collection advanced queries. Subject terms are used to describe standards listed in our glossary representative of our landscape review and are in alignment with the [FAIRsharing Subject Ontology (SRAO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/srao) where applicable. SRAO imports terms from existing ontologies (DCTERMS, DC, NCIT, IAO, PO, OIO, EDAM, OMIT, OBI). SRAO hierarchy covers a broad range subject matter terms and where external vocabularies could not be found SRAO classes exist.  The [terms4FAIRskills (T4FS)](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology/) identifiers were used for RDMkit and MOMSI research data lifecycle terms to support FAIR data stewardship. 

### RDMkit Research Data Lifecycle Classes
Core concept terms, as defined by the RDMkit resource, are implemented in our issues requests and represent potential standard selections based on data management  [roles](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/your_role) and [tasks](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/your_tasks) performed at each stage (Planning, Collecting, Processing, Analyzing, Preserving, Sharing, Reusing). 

### MOMSI Research Data Lifecycle Subclasses
Concept subclass terms, as defined by the MOMSI WG, for expanding on core RDMkit data lifecycle terms with use-case specific data management or stewardship tasks as they apply under each stage. 

**Note:** MOMSI WG defined terms in the glossary have not been assigned an identifier. After WG output community review and feedback we will further refine these selection terms as needed and seek opportunities to add these terms to an existing maintained ontology collection within scope.
