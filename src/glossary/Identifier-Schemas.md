term:: Identifier Schemas
definition:: Describe publicly-available identifiers assigned by a generalist or domain central registry service provider. Identifier schema records are intended to describe persistent and unique identifiers that can be used and shared across multiple resources for reporting the location of where the data being described is stored. Domain identifiers are usually intended to be minted for a single repository or resource service provider, but can also be generally assigned based on the product type being shared (definition source: FAIRsharing).
