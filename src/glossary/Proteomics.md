term:: Proteomics
definition:: Protein and peptide identification, especially in the study of whole proteomes of organisms. Includes metaproteomics: proteomics analysis of an environmental sample. Proteomics includes any methods (especially high-throughput) that separate, characterize and identify expressed proteins such as mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein microarrays, as well as in-silico methods that perform proteolytic or mass calculations on a protein sequence and other analyses of protein production data, for example in different cells or tissues (definition source: EDAM).
