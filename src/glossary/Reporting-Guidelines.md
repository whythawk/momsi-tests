term:: Reporting Guidelines
definition:: Checklists providing the minimal descriptive information required to evaluate, interpret, and disseminate experimental data. Reporting guidelines define a common set of general or domain metadata to guide researchers in reporting the scientific context submitted to data repositories, required by journals, funders, or community accepted data standards. Often reporting guidelines do not have a literal checklist, rather presented as documentation stating the required and/or optional attributes describing the reported results (definition source: FAIRsharing).
