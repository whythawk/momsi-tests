term:: Analyzing
definition:: Data analysis consists in exploring the collected data to begin understanding the messages contained in a dataset and/or in applying mathematical formula (or models) to identify relationships between variables. The steps of the workflow in the analysis phase will often be repeated several times to explore the data as well as to optimize the workflow itself. According to the different types of data (quantitative or qualitative) the data analysis methods will differ. Data analysis follows the (often automated, batch) data processing stage (definition source: RDMkit).
