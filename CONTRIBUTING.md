# Contribution Guidelines

The quickest way to contribute to this resource is to submit an issue request:

- Submit **new standards** using one of our [Omics issue templates](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/issues/new/choose). A new pull request will be generated automatically for you. 
- Update **existing standards** directly from the dashboard while browsing the Omics themed standard report tables. Click on the ``🖋️Update`` link provided on each row listed in the far right column under each themed table. 

> 🔥Use of persistent identifier assignments for tracking continuous curation
> - _Each standards listed at the dashboard are assigned a unique and persistent identifier for tracking continuous updates, version control, and curation transparency._
> - _See themed prefix pattern assignment examples below representative of each parent class._
> 
> | Prefix  | Theme | Standard ID | Standard Acronym |
> | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
> | MOMSI_G | Genomics | ```MOMSI_G:00000``` | SO |
> | MOMSI_P | Proteomics | ```MOMSI_P:00009``` | mzQC |
> | MOMSI_M | Metabolomics | ```MOMSI_M:00002``` | ChEBI |
> | MOMSI_U | Universal | ```MOMSI_U:00033``` | BFO |

- For any updates that don't have a corresponding template, please start with a [blank issue](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/issues/new).

> ℹ️Record Removal Curation Policy
> - Included standard curations cannot be removed once they have been added to the dashboard. In unique circumstances where this may be required, please get in touch with the MOMSI WG Co-chairs. 
> - This policy is aimed to encourage continuous curation and transparency in mapping standard relationship lineage (where applicable) identify any potential dependencies that may exist between standards (depreciation vs. deprecation). Visit the Glossary to determine which Status curation term best.
> - It is highly encouraged to update any status changes to standards where applicable using our required and defined terminology ("Established", Established/Maintained", "In Development", "Uncertain", and "Depreciated").

## 📖 Getting CRediT
The MOMSI dashboard contribution log captures the minimum required information (_Issue, Date, Name, ORCID ID, CRediT Role, and Standard ID_) in providing the appropriate attribution to community members collectively curating new standards and/or updating existing standards represented at the dashboard repository.

> ℹ️CRediT Role Guidance
> - ✔️ **Existing Standards**
CRediT selections for "Data curation, Writing – review & editing" are applied for updating existing standards currently captured in MOMSI WG landscape review list.
> - ➕ **New Standards**
CRediT selections for "Data curation, Writing – original draft" are applied for adding new standards not previously captured in the landscape review dashboard.
